Dice Roll: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Dice Roll app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Sanjiv Singh. the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.)) is stored on your device only, an can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,

sanjiv Kumar Singh
